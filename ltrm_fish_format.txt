                        FISH TREND ANALYSIS DATA                               

Annual fish monitoring on the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS)            
was implemented in 1990 under the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program        
(LTRMP).  Some preliminary sampling was conducted during 1989 to test          
sampling methods in Pools 8, 13 and 26; however, these data are best           
viewed as developmental data that are less useful for routine trend            
analysis.                                                                      

From 1990 through 1992, all fish sampling was conducted at subjectively        
chosen permanently fixed sampling sites within each aquatic area.              
Each site consisted of a pair of sampling locations separated by about         
50 meters (occasionally separated by as much as 200 meters).  In the           
original LTRMP fish sampling design, these pairs of sampling locations         
within fixed sites were considered replicates for the site and for the         
aquatic area.                                                                  

A statistical review of the sampling program was planned and conducted         
during 1992, critically examining the original LTRMP fish monitoring           
design and considering design alternatives.  The final report from this        
review (Gutreuter 1993) is available by request from the UMESC.                

A second statistical review of the sampling program was planned and            
conducted during 2001, critically examining whether sampling efficiencies      
could be gained.  The final report from this review                            
(Ickes and Burkhardt 2002) is available by request from the                    
Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center.                                   

As a result of the 1992 statistical review of the LTRMP fish monitoring        
program, major procedural changes were implemented in 1993.                    
The LTRMP Fisheries Component adopted a stratified random sampling design,     
with aquatic areas serving as strata.  Spatially randomized sites, with        
proper independent replication within strata, are currently sampled.           
Subjectively chosen permanently fixed sites have been retained in              
tailwaters (which are too small to permit meaningful replicated random         
sampling) and at a few sites of special interest (having historical            
occurrences of endangered species, associated with                             
habitat restoration projects, etc.).                                           

The 2001 statistical review resulted in minor procedural changes that          
were implemented in 2002.  Specifically, four gears were removed from the      
sampling design (night electrofishing, seining, tandem fyke nets, and          
tandem mini fyke nets).  Thus, beginning in 2002, data associated with         
these four gear types are neither available from nor collected by              
the program.  Please review Ickes and Burkhardt (2002) for details             
regarding this change in procedure.

Use of LTRMP Trend Data for Fish Monitoring                                    

The sampling design for fishes is sufficiently complex that all potential      
users of these data are strongly encouraged to read and understand the Fish    
Monitoring section of the LTRMP Procedures Manual (Gutreuter et al. 1995),     
which describes both historical and current procedures, before undertaking     
any analysis or interpretation of data.  This document is accessible

                                   SUMMARY                                     

LTRMP Fish Sampling Design                                                     

The LTRMP conducts annual monitoring of fishes in six study reaches of the     
Upper Mississippi River System:  Navigation Pools 4, 8, 13 and 26, and an      
unimpounded reach near Cape Girardeau, Missouri, on the Mississippi River; and 
La Grange Pool on the Illinois River.  The LTRMP will continue to expand fish  
monitoring beyond these six study reaches, and welcomes participation by other 
agencies and groups that could sample other areas using the LTRMP sampling     
protocol.                                                                      

The LTRMP conducts highly standardized fish sampling in main channel border,   
tailwater, side channel, contiguous (to the main channel or side channels)     
backwater, and impounded aquatic areas in each study reach.  Sampling is       
conducted using electrofishing, hoop netting, fyke (trap) netting, seining,    
and trawling.                                                                  

Fish sampling is conducted from June 15 through July 31, August 1 through      
September 14, and September 15 through October 31.  Prior to 1993, each fixed  
site was sampled once (two "replicates" per site) during each time period.     
Beginning in 1993, independently distributed sampling sites have been sampled  
within a combination of stratum and time period.                               

Gears and use of gear are highly standardized within the LTRMP.  See the Fish  
Monitoring section of the LTRMP Procedures Manual (Gutreuter et al. 1995) for  
details.                                                                       

Data Composition                                                               

Principal fish data collected are species composition, relative abundance      
(catch-per-unit-effort) and length distribution of catches.  Subsamples from   
a few species (particularly freshwater drum) are collected for age             
determination, growth analysis, and examination of food use.  The LTRMP also   
collects considerable site-specific data on environmental conditions and       
quality assurance measures.  LTRMP data and their interpretation are described 
in Gutreuter et al. 1994.

All fields in the data file are comma separated with each record of data on one row of the file.
The first row of the data file contains the field names, this row is also comma speparated.
The CSV file format is very useful because most programs that allow data to be imported can
import csv files.  For example if you have Microsoft Excel installed once you download the 
zip file and extract out the csv file you can just double click the csv file and it will open
in Microsoft Excel.

Field Descriptions



SITE ALIAS
Used to record an optional site alias for field station use.


BARCODE
Identifying barcode for fish data sheets


START DATE
Date on which a gear collection was initiated (e.g., the date on which
a net was set).
Ten-digit numeric mm/dd/yyyy format, example April 1, 1995, is represented as
04/01/1995.


FISH COUNT
Numeric field to record counts of fish represented by
the row of data. Fish Count is 1 for all individually measured
lengths and weights and ÷1 for bulk counts. For example, if a
particular fish was measured to the nearest 1 millimeter, then Fish
Count is 1. If just one fish of a particular length group is
encountered during length group enumeration, then Fish Count is
also 1 for that length group. However, if 10 fish of a length
group are encountered during group enumeration, then Fish
Count is 10.
